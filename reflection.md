Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    Tseegi Nyamdorj, Zhirou Liu
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    9/21 office hour
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    It is less intuitive than Python, I had to search up a lot of syntax in order to write the assignment. I also feel like since I am not familiar with Java yet, I could not make my code elegant -- there are many places where it felt like I was doing a lot more typing than I could -- but that's just the process of learning a new language.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    You need to have a very clear big image in your head about where your code is going. It is very easy to get lost in the details during coding to loose track of the end goal. This is why pseudocoding or just writing out how your program should work in the end is very important to do before you begin any coding.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Googling syntax and learning along the way was tiring and confusing. Even though I got my code to work in the end, I wish Professor could have systematically taught us about the key syntax (arrays, strings, etc) needed to complete this assignment. Going to the office hour helped a lot since Jordan gave us a starting code to work with, but I would appreciate it greatly if he could give us more information for us to start on the assignments in class, rather than in office hours. I worked with a friend from the class to figure out the code together, and it helped immensely to have a partner to talk to. Sometimes just hearing myself say the problem out loud helped me figure out what was wrong by myself. An advice I would give is to find a study buddy and go to OH and TA for help.
